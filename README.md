# Raspberry_Car_AGV
Recently, vehicles are gradually equipped with autonomous driving functions, lane detection plays an important role. In this thesis, the main electric vehicle control system is established based on raspberry Pi, using camera recognizes image from the road and marking.

 Keywords—Differential speed steering, Four-wheel independent driving, Electric vehicle, Lane detection, Hough transform, Canny edge detection, HSV
